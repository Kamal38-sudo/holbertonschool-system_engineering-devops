        Database Server (MySQL Primary/Replica)





1)Additional Server

Reason: Split components onto dedicated machines (Web, App, Database)

Benefit:

Reduces resource conflicts

Improves security (database isolated from web layer)

Makes scaling easier (can scale web or app independently)

2)Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy)

Reason: High availability and redundancy for the load balancer itself

Benefit:

Eliminates the SPOF caused by a single load balancer

Distributes traffic evenly across backend servers

Performs health checks to remove failed servers automatically

Cluster Mode: Two or more load balancers in Active-Active or Active-Passive setup

3)Dedicated Web Server

Reason: Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests and serves static content

Benefit:

Offloads static content serving from application servers

Improves performance

Can scale horizontally without touching database or app servers

4)Dedicated Application Server

Reason: Executes backend code and business logic

Benefit:

Keeps application logic separate from web and database layers

Improves security (application code not exposed directly to internet)

Can scale independently to handle more requests

5)Dedicated Database Server

Reason: Stores all persistent data in one centralized location

Benefit:

Dedicated resources for read/write operations

Easier to maintain and back up

Can implement Primary-Replica replication for high availability

6)Clustered Load Balancers

Reason: Avoid SPOF at the load balancer layer

Benefit:

If one LB fails, the other continues serving traffic

Improves uptime and reliability
