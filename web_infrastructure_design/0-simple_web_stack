What is a server?

A server is a computer that provides services to other computers (clients) over a network.

In our case, the server hosts the web application, application code, and database.

It responds to requests from user's browsers and sends back the requested data.


What is the role of the domain name?

A domain name (like foobar.com) is a human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address.

Users don't need to remember numerical IP addresses like 8.8.8.8.

The domain makes it easy to access the website from any browser.



What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?

The www is a subdomain of foobar.com.

It is associated with an A record in DNS, which maps the domain/subdomain to the server's IP address.


What is the role of the web server?

The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from users.

It can:

Serve static content (HTML, CSS, JS) directly

Forward dynamic requests to the application server for processing



What is the role of the application server?

The application server runs the website codebase (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.)

Processes dynamic requests, interacts with the database, and generates responses.

Example: when a user submits a form, the application server validates input and stores data in the database.


What is the role of the database?

The database (MySQL) stores persistent data for the website.

It handles queries for:

User information

Posts, products, or any dynamic content

Sessions and application state

The application server queries the database to read or write data.


What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?

The server uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol over the internet.

The communication involves:

Browser sends request -> server receives

Server processes request â-> generates response -> browser displays content
